    "\n",
    "Franchising offers aspiring entrepreneurs the opportunity to invest in proven business models with the potential for large returns on your investment. One such franchising opportunity is The Joint Chiropractic, which has been transforming the cost and accessibility of Chiropractic care by situating its locations near retail settings.\n",
    "The Joint Chiropractic franchise has touted exceptional growth due to its small footprint, low overhead and no inventory business model.  The company allows it clients to receive affordable chiropractic care with monthly plans at a cost of $39 per visit.  The franchise also advertises that it leverages Global Information Strategies and customer analytics to evaluate the ideal locations for future sites.\n",
    "One of my close friends is interested in investing in the Joint Franchise.

    "2.What tools can be sued to help gauge customer impressions of the Joint Chiropractic as a brand and assess the overall impression of this franchise in the United States?  \n",
    "3.By applying the Data Science approach, can we evaluate 2 local sites in the Atlanta area and determine if either are potentially acceptable locations for opening a local Joint Franchise?\n",
